  <content>So far, our travel management is still characterized by many forms and manual transfers. We want to
completely replace this old system with a new, paperless system that will reduce the costs of processing
travel requests and travel reimbursements and that will simplify the booking and documentation for the
travelling employee.

The travel management system should support all employees in planning their business trips. Up to 100
employees should be able to work with it at the same time with response times of less than 5 seconds.
If an employee wants to travel, he or she uses the system to plan the travel. The system shall request the
required travel data from the employee and then automatically plan a travel itinerary. To do so, it shall
request options for transportation from our registered vendors, i.e. airlines, rail companies and car rental
companies. For hotel booking, the system shall be connected to our partner travel agencies to automatically
make inquiries. With this information on available transportation options and hotels, the system shall
suggest an itinerary to the travelling employee.

If the employee is satisfied with the itinerary, he or she sends the itinerary through the system. It will then
be presented to the line manager unless the employee has the right to self-authorize travel. Finally, the
itinerary is checked by an employee of the travel department. The employee of the travel department will
clarify any inquiries concerning cheaper or better options directly with the traveling employee. Once all the
queries have been clarified, the employee of the travel department will confirm the itinerary and the system
will book the corresponding others through the systems of the vendors and of the travelling agency.

After the trip, the employee can also use the system for reimbursements by scanning and uploading the
receipts. After a final examination by the travel department, the expenses of the employee are then
reimbursed. In order to increase the company-wide benefits, the system should also be able to generate
reports that help the controlling department to reduce the travel costs at Sigurado.

For authorization of employees, the new system must be connected to our central Identity Management
System, operated by the IT Services, because we do not want to manage the rights more than once. Any
unauthorized access to the system should be prevented. I think the system should also be operated in the
data center of our IT services so that the existing infrastructure can be used cost-efficiently.

Sentence tests:
